Blender add-on to render LaTeX and import it into Blender

This Blender add-on is designed to import graphics generated by LaTeX and import them as curve objects in Blender. In the 3D View, it shows up under "Add > Mesh."

## Requirements

This add-on works as a normal Blender add-on, but it requires the following be installed on your computer.

1. `latex` -- The add-on uses the local LaTeX installation to compile entered LaTeX code.
1. `dvisvgm` -- The add-on uses this tool to convert LaTeX outputted .dvi into an .svg file
