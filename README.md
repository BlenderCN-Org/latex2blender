Blender add-on to render LaTeX and import it into Blender

This Blender add-on is designed to import Latex graphics into Blender as mesh objects. In object mode in the 3D View, it shows up as a panel in the sidebar. Type "n" to open the sidebar.

## Requirements

This add-on works as a normal Blender add-on, but it requires the following be installed on your computer.

1. `latex` -- The add-on uses the local LaTeX installation to compile entered LaTeX code.
1. `dvisvgm` -- The add-on uses this tool to convert LaTeX outputted .dvi into an .svg file
